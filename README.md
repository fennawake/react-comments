# Comments React System

This is a personal project I created to start my learming with React JS.
It's a simple project to create comments and show this comments.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm my-app create-react app`

Run  this command to create your project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
